            <h2>RICH ARCHITECTURE</h2>
            <p>
              The finesse and grandeur of Odisha's architecture is exhibited in
              its temples that the Aryans left behind. Some of them are among
              the finest in the country. Of these, the most important are the
              Lingaraja Temple, Bhubaneswar (11th century), Jagannath Temple at
              Puri (12th century) and the great Sun Temple at Konark (13th
              century). And hence, the golden triangle of Odisha - Bhubaneswar,
              Konark and Puri contributes the maximum amount of tourism
              goodwill. They are primary temples built in the style of 'Kalinga'
              architecture.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2 class="text">Lingaraja Temple</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              The largest of all temples that the Temple City of Bhubaneswar
              boasts of, it is one of the major tourist attractions of the state
              with over 6000 visitors on a daily basis. Here, Lord Shiva is
              worshipped as Harihara, a combined form of Vishnu and Shiva.<br />To

            <h2>ARTISTIC CULTURE OF ODISHA</h2>
            <h2>Pattachitra (Cloth Painting)</h2>
            <p>
              Literally, 'Patta' translates to cloth and 'Chitra' means picture.
              The themes and motifs are mythological, typically revolving around
              the Jagannath and Vaishnava sect. Lord Jagannath and Radha-Krishna
              paintings are a rage among buyers.
            </p>
            <h2>Sand Art</h2>
            <p>
              With clean, fine-grained sand and water as its raw materials, this
              is an indigenous form of art that found its origin recently if a
              comparison is drawn to the other forms of art. It is practised on
              the beaches of Puri with subjects ranging from Hindu deities to
              international occasions.
            </p>
            <h2>Appliqué Work</h2>
            <p>
              This is a famous fabric craft originating from a village called
              Pipili where locals call it 'Pipili Chandua Kama'. Unknown to
              many, Pipili holds an entry in the Limca Book of Records for the
              world's largest thematic applique work.

            <h2>ODISSI</h2>
            <p>
              Originally performed by Devadasis, Odissi bears the closest
              resemblance to temple culture than any other existing form of
              dance. It traditionally depicts the divine love between Lord
              Krishna and his consort Radha, drawing inspirations from the
              lyrical compositions of poet Jayadeva. The dance basically
              involves a mythical story, symbolic costumes, abhinaya
              (expressions), mudras (gestures) and is extremely graceful.
            </p>
            <h2>GOTIPUA</h2>
            <p>
              Gotipua refers to boy dancers who dress up as girls. Always
              dancing in pairs, boys aged from 6 to 14 are usually students of
              akhadas or gymnasia set in the periphery of the Puri temple.
              Enthralling acrobatic moves complement the singing which is done
              by the boys themselves.
            </p>
            <h2>DALKHAI(Sambalpuri)</h2>
            <p>
              Ask any Odia about Odisha's folk dances and 'Sambalpuri' might be
              the first thing you will hear. There are many other forms of
              Sambalpuri dance but Dalkhai is the most famous one.
